  <h1> JavaScript 1 </h1>
  <p> When we make a webpage, JavaScript can go into a &lt;script&gt; tag. One big part of JavaScript is called
    "imperative programming." This means that you are creating commands telling the computer what to do. The first
    "command" we will learn is </p>
  <p>
    <code> document.write("Hello"); </code>
  </p>

  <p>P.S. (The proper way to say "command" is "statement". JavaScript programs are composed of a series of JavaScript
    "statements")</p>

  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <p> Let's start with some examples!</p>
  <script>
    document.write("Hello from JavaScript! ");
    document.write("I am telling you... ");
    document.write("don't forget the quotation marks! ");
    document.write("Every single letter and character is important. ");
    document.write('Very important. ');
    


  </script>

  <h3>You try it!</h3>
  <p>Now you try! Fill out the 3 <code>document.write();</code> statements below with your own text. Then write 5 more
    statements of your own, for a total of 8! </p>
  <script>
    document.write("This is my first attempt at writing Javascript. ");
    document.write("So far, I think it's pretty cool. ");
    document.write("I think I'm going to love javascript.");
    document.write("I've heard that Javascript can get pretty complicated. ")
    document.write("I just so happen to like challenges. ")
    document.write("Therefore, i'm up for the challenge. ")
    document.write("No pain, no gain!!  ")
    document.write("So it's time to learn how to write and master Javascript!!  Lets get it!!!")

  </script>
